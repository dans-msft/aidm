This adventure is a classic D&D dungeon crawl.

The player begins the game outside a small town.  The town is there to allow the player to purchase supplies, rest up, and learn information.
The town consists of a central town square and the following buildings:
The Inn:
  The Inn is a place to meet people, learn information, and rest the night.
  The Inn has tables where a number of different adventurers can be found who might join the player on their quest.

The General Store:
  This store sells basic adventuring supplies including lanterns, torches, ropes, lockpicks, rations, and sometimes a special item or two.

The Outfitter:
  This store sells weapons and armor.  Many choices are available but the player will always be able to find something suitable for their class.
  Sometimes the player can find special weapons or armor for sale here though the price will be high.

The Potion shop:
  This store sells various magical potions, including healing potions and antidotes for poison.


A road leads out from the town.  A distance along the road the player will find the entrance to The Tomb of the Ancient King.
The Tomb of the Ancient King is a recently-discovered tomb that holds the promise of great treasure but is defended by
fearsome monsters and clever traps.  The deeper the player ventures into the Tomb, the more dangeous the monsters become and
the more intricate the traps and puzzles.  But the greater the reward!

The tomb is dark and so the player will need a light source.

Upon entering the tomb, the player will descend a staircase.  There is a dart trap triggered by a tripwire halfway down that
will do 1d4 points of damage to whoever triggers it.
