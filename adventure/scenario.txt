This adventure takes place in the Kingdom of Eventuride.  Eventuride is a fantsay kingdom set in a world of heros and magic,
containing great treasures and ferocious beasts.

The kingdom lies between the Great Sea to the south and the tall Mountains of Might to the north.  Between the two lies the vast Eldor Forest,
which is rumored to hide many secrets.  The mighty Trane River runs south from the mountains to the sea, dividng the kingdom roughly in half.
At the mouth of the river is the great capital city of Doon, a bustling seaside metropolis flanked by a great palace just northwest of the city.
The King's Road leads north by northwest away from the city through the more populared western half of the Kingdom.  Fishing villages dot the coast
which extends west and south of the capital.

To the east the coast becomes more rugged and the roads are less traveled.  A few small towns lie along the coast, connected to the capital by
simple roads, but beyond that lies the Wild Coast.  To the Northeast of Doon the forest becomes dense, tangled, and more difficult to traverse.
Few go this way except along the Old Road which stays near the east bank of the Trane River.

Three Days north of Doon along the Old Road stands old Riverton, and old town highlighted by one of the northernmost bridges to span the Trane.
From here the Old Road turns northeast, passing through the Town of Eldoria on its way toward the mountains.  Eldoria and the forest that
surrounds it is a popular stop for adventurers seeking their fortune in the deep forest and the northern mountains.

You begin your journey along the Old Road by the entrance to Eldoria.
You are a young wizard fresh out of the magical academy.  Tired of the big city, you traveled here from the capital looking for fortune and aventure.
You have 8 health and a pouch with 20 gold pieces.  You carry a wooden staff and wear a cloth tunic.
You have a spell book with the only three spells you know: Magic Missile, Shield, and Charm Person.
