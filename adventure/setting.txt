The setting for this adventure consists of a town named Eldoria which is surrounded by a deep forest which butts up against
mountains to the north.

Eldoria is a small town of around 250 people.  It it a good place to meet up with other adventurers and contains
the usual assortment of buildings: an inn, a market, individual shops selling goods, a small temple, and a nice residence occupied by
the lord of the region.  It is a good base for adventure.

The forest is tangled and difficult to navigate, especially farther away from town.  It has several key points of interest:
- a set of old ruins, located deep within the forest.  The player is unlikely to find this without obtaining the necessary clues from the town.
- a network of caves.  There are several entrances to this network scattered in different parts of the forest on the edge of the mountains.
- bandit camps.  There are several camps in the woods which serve as a base for bandits who have been plaguing the town.
- monster camps.  Deeper into the forest are some camps of monsters like goblins.  The player is likely to come close to one of these
while looking for the ruins or the caves.

The player's starting location is on the main road right outside of Eldoria.  From this location it should be possible to enter the
town as well as venture into the surrounding forest.
